# Regression Analysis

## Regression Analysis of Sales Price of a Whole Sale Walmart Store 

It is an analysis and evaluation of the sale prices for the wholesale store Walmart. We are performing regression analysis to understand the trend between sale prices and the corresponding factors based on the previous research and identifying the significant regressor factors and to check for the possible interaction between the same. Various regression techniques have been employed in order to achieve a satisfactory model to predict the sale prices in the future and take influential management decisions in order to increase the same. Various Regression techniques such as Multiple Regression, Model Accuracy Checking, diagnostics for outliers or influential points, indicator variables, handling multicollinearity, performing variable selection and model building and validation of the same are used. 

## Handling Time Series 

Additionally, this data being a time series data, we had to check for possible Autocorrelation in the model. Autocorrelation can be treated by addition of predictor variables or implementing various parameter estimation methods such as Cochrane-Orcutt method. We have implemented Cochrane-Orcutt method to eliminate Autocorrelation and make the data set Uncorrelated. We successfully uncorrelated. 

## Model Validation 

We performed the further statistical analysis for model validation and checked for outliers or influential points in the data set. We increased the accuracy of the model after eliminating these observations. Then we performed further analysis by fitting the full factorial model and then eliminating the insignificant interaction terms and co-efficient that led to increase in the variance. We have eliminated possible multicollinearity ill-conditioning. After all the statistical analysis we finalized the model with adequate accuracy. Based on the final model and analysis run we have mentioned certain recommendations and possible ways to increase the accuracy of the model at the end of this report.
